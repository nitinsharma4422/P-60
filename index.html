            <br><br>
            It also has social and psychological benefits.
            <br><br>
            You can play with a club or with friends and family as a social activity.
            <br><br>
            Make sure you have plenty of fluids on hand and rehydrate regularly.
            <br><br>
            Not dependent on youth or strength â€“ you can play for a lifetime or start the game at any age.
            <br><br>
